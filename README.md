# CookieJar

This mod adds allows server developers to view, edit, and save the new cookies from snapshot [24w03a](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-snapshot-24w03a). Features include:

- Add, remove, edit, and send cookies
- Edit cookie data as string or byte array
- Import/export cookies to file
- Optionally ignore cookie and transfer packets
- Simulate a transfer packet, including from singleplayer (no need to set up two servers anymore!)

## Usage

Add a hotkey to the cookie editor in the controls menu, then press that key in a singleplayer or multiplayer session.

## Building

Build with `gradle build`.
